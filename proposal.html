        <h2>IV. Story</h2>
        <p>This is an abstract, generic shooter so there isn't much story.
            The premise is to just survive.
            The mood and theme is action-y, and at times fast-paced.</p>
        <p>The objective? Don't die for as long as possible, your score depends on it.</p>

        <p>Sound style: Looped music with a fast feel.</p>

        <h2>VI. Gameplay</h2>
        <h3>Mechanics</h3>
        <p>The mechanics are simple: dodge incoming enemies and fire to destroy them.</p>

        <h3>Control</h3>
        <p>The controls are bound to the keyboard; arrow keys and WASD to move and [space] to fire bullets.</p>

        <h3>Teaching the game/New user experience aka "Onboarding"</h3>
        <p>The controls will be displayed to the side of the canvas where the game is shown.</p>

        <h3>Screenshots</h3>
        <div class="imageGallery">
            <img src="images/Game_Start.png" alt="The start screen">
            <img src="images/Gameplay.png" alt="The gameplay">
            <img src="images/Game_Over.png" alt="The game over screen">
        </div>

        <h3>Process</h3>
        <p>
            First I worked on creating the buttons for the screen and then began on the actual style of the page.
            After making sure the game screen was set up I wrote code to handle the status display on the side and then
            created a timer by using the setInterval() method to call a function that would add to the time displayed
            every second.
        </p>
        <p>
            I then went on to modify the Ship class into a Player class and different enemy classes.
            The enemy types have their own movement behaviour, for now that is mainly just differences in speed, but
            hopefully in the future I can add more.
        </p>
        <p>
            I started out using the Circle Blast HW and erased most of the code in the methods, leaving the helper
            script and the structure of the main script behind to use as the foundation.
            The game loop would handle spawning enemies, moving the player and handling collisions as well as
            increasing and decreasing the score.
        </p>
        <p>
            While I was working I unfortunately couldn't get the enemy firing to work, so, because the deadline was
            coming up, I decided the challenge would come from not just dodging enemy ships so as to
            avoid damage, but also you had to keep the ships from getting past you and off the screen.
        </p>

        <h3>Requirements</h3>
        <p>
            The classes I made for the game are enemies which are pretty much
            the same as the player class (which is modified from the ship class from Circle Blast)
            and I used the bullet class as well from the Circle Blast HW.
        </p>
        <p>
            I feel that this is different from Circle Blast in that firstly, the objective is different.
            Instead of just shooting circles to increase your score, you're trying to keep the enemy ships from getting
            past you which decreases your score. Of course there are also differences in the backend of the game, the 
            enemy spawning is handled differently and in the future I can hopefully 
            get the enemies to shoot and display different firing patterns and behaviours.
        </p>
        <p>
            As I mentioned before, I couldn't get the enemy firing to work before the deadline 
            but I came up with another idea to make the game more challenging. When the enemy ships reach the bottom 
            of the screen the player loses points.
